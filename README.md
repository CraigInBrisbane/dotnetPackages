# dotnetPackages
A project using the Mediatr pattern, but making use of the latest helpful packages.

## Goal
I am looking to maintage a solution using best practices and the best packages to assist with creating a good clean architecture. The plan is to have people contribute, and objectivly critisize the design and methods.

This project has no UI (yet), as it's a demonstration of backend development.

## Packages and Framework
This project has been created using .Net 5.0, and will hopefully follow the latest framework releases. Additionally, Nuget packages will be updated as they become avaialble, unless they're broken. Packages that will be used:

* Mediatr (Added)
* Entity Framework Core (SQL server) (Added - Not being used)
* AutoMapper (Added)
* NUnit (Not yet added)
* Moq (Not yet added)
* Swagger (Added)
* JWT Tokens (Not yet added)
* Identity Server (Not yet added)

## The project
The project achieves nothing. The plan is to add functionality that will showcase the packages we use, and will continually be added to. As of now, the plan is to login, and be authenticated. Basically showing that we get a 200 on a protected endpoint.

I have no experience with some of these, and wouldn't mind learning Micro Services - so the project will be designed with that in mind.

## Usage
This was built using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition. You should just need to pull down the repo, open the solution, and it should run. Running it, produces the Swagger page, allowing you to run the endpoints.
